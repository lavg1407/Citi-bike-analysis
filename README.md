# Citi-bike-analysis

Since 2013, the Citi Bike Program has implemented a robust infrastructure for collecting data on the program's utilization. Through the team's efforts, each month bike data is collected, organized, and made public on the Citi Bike Data webpage.

However, while the data has been regularly updated, the team has yet to implement a dashboard or sophisticated reporting process. City officials have a number of questions on the program, so your first task on the job is to build a set of data reports to provide the answers.

# Data

This Citi Bike Data has been processed to remove trips that are taken by staff as they service and inspect the system and any trips that were below 60 seconds in length (potentially false starts or users trying to re-dock a bike to ensure it's secure). https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data
